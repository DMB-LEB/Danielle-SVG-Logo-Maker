# Danielle-SVG-Logo-Maker


## Description
The purpose of this application is to create a quik and simple logo using Node JS. The application runs via CLI, collecting user input data through inquirer, once user input data is received a logo is created as an SVG file in which they can open and view.

Below in the Usage section is a walkthrough demonstrating how to utilize this application


## Installation
You will need Node.js: v18.17.1
npm: v9.6.7
inquirer: v8.2.6
I recommend installing the Live Server extension, available through Visual Studio Code
Svg Preview extension (Also available through Visual Studio Code) is useful, but not required 
Chrome, Edge, and Safari browsers all open the SVG file


## Usage
Below is a video demonstrating how to use the SVG Logo Maker. However once this repo is cloned and you have NPM (Node Package Manager installed), you would go to your terminal and run "node index.js" from there, you would get prompted to input needed information, and then you should be able to open your SVG logo in your web console.
